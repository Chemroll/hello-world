Delivering high-quality goods requires making sure that programs, software, or code are safe and functioning. Consider the following important practices:
a. Quality assessment: To confirm functioning and find possible problems in the code, use comprehensive testing techniques.
b. Code Reviews: To get a new perspective on your code, do code reviews with colleagues or team members. Finding logical mistakes, security flaws, and possible enhancements can be aided by code reviews.
c. Security procedures and assessments: Comply with secure code guidelines, which include parameterized queries, input validation, encryption, and authentication methods. Regularly do security assessments, such as vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, to find any possible security flaws in your program. Any vulnerabilities found should be fixed right away.
